1)  additional 1 bit flag to tell if processor is currently handling an interrupt
    denote this flag as F_i. F_i = 0 by default
2)  additional register to store incoming char
    denote this register as R_char.

top level
1)  if F_i = 0, enable the keyboard and pop the current char to the processor
    else disable keyboard from popping character

processor level
Check if valid char. If valid char:
-------------this clock cycle-------------
1)  save R0-R15, F0-F4, PC to back-up registers for next clock cycle
2)  set F_i = 1 for next clock cycle
3)  set R_char = incoming char for next clock cycle
4)  branch to place in ROM to handle interrupt on next clock cycle 
------------next clock cycle--------------
process keyboard input. Then,
1)  restore R0-15, F0-F4
2)  set F_i = 0 for next clock cycle
3)  set R_char = 0 for next clock cycle
4)  use stored PC to branch back to original place in ROM


Not sure if we need separate custom opcodes for backup, set interrupt state, store char


Backing Up to RAM
Before backing up, specify a register that should hold the branch address of the 
interrupt code

Specify/add a register to hold the contents of PC. Have the PC output be directly
wired to this register

1) Branch to location holding the code for the interrupt
2) Save flags to a register (designate one)
3) Store R0-R15 in RAM
